# Worthy
Worthy is a 2D bullet hell roguelite game where you traverse through a number of rooms throught out a castle where you can earn gold to purchase new abilities and potions to help defeat hordes of enemies.

*DISCLAIMER*

This version of the game is not cohesive whatsoever, it is still being developed and each room is tested individually from one another.
If starting from the main menu you can go see what it is like as if you have just started the game with only one ability. The test room you get to will not end. Also when selecting the rooms you should click the generate button at the botton right so you can select the first room as this is the only one that will work.
There is the "Hole In The Wall" room which is the shop room for the game where you can buy abilities and then drag them from the inventory into the hotbar, you can then enter the game to test these abilities.
